# Hugo Bulma Starter

> This starter has been tested only with the "extended" version of Hugo 0.53.

To get started, install [Bulma](https://bulma.io) using npm or Yarn.

Once you've installed the Bulma assets, you can run the site locally:

```shell
hugo server
```

Open your browser to http://localhost:1313 and you should see a basic landing page.
